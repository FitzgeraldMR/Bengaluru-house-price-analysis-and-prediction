# Bengaluru-house-price-analysis-and-prediction
Used python to analyse and train the data to produce a model that is able to detect the prices of houses area wise as well as other parameters. Also used PyCharm to create servers for a website to be designed in the near future. The website would be the interface for the predictor model.
